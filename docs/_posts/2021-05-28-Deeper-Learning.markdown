Title: Deeper Learning

The deeper learning method of adult learning, is just that AFTER you've learned all the basic dependent concepts, learn some touchstone concepts.

For example:
"Unlike other vendor clouds, a subnet spans zones, enabling VMs with adjacent IPs to exist in separate zones, making design for availability easier to accomplish since the VMs can share tagged firewall rules."

To understand the above statement, the basic dependent knowledge that must already be understood includes, Regions, Zones, Subnets, IP Addresses, and Firewall Rules.

These basic concepts are not taught or reviewed in this course. They are taught in the training courses in this specialization and in the corresponding learning track in instructor led training.
Advice: Evaluate the dependent basic concepts
Assess your confidence with each touchstone concept as it is presented. Don't expect to be taught the basic concept. If you don't understand the touchstone at all, or if you don't feel confident in your knowledge of it, or if you feel there are specific elements of it that you don't understand or are not confident about -- take note!  

This is an area where more preparation can be of benefit for you.

Also -- note where you are confident, know the material, and the dependent concepts on which the touchstone is based. These areas require less preparation for you. So noting what you know well can help make your preparation activities more efficient.
