Today is the first day to work at InfoSys.

I got the suit ready, shirts ironed, all required documents in a file.

Tomorrow, according to plan, I'll be back right at home, working remotely. Would everything just be fine, or would it seems fine on the surface?

What would we do today? What should I say when greeting my fellows?

When would today end? Or would it be eternally different, just that I don't know it yet?

There's only one way to find out.

Oh, BTW, I passed 1 of 8 courses on Google's Data Analyst course.

Here's the certificate.
