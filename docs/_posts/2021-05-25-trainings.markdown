So it's been a while, I must confess.

There has been several urge for me to write something, but all ended with kicking back with a Perrier and my new PS5.

Well, at least I'm here now.

It's been almost two months now since I started my career as an IT consultant. During which period, I was supposed to receive training with my peers. However, I was arrogant enough to ask for a permission to be under self-learning mode instead, given that I already *knew* Java, SQL and other sorts. So during this time, I've been doing pretty much the same things with that when I was still a student; simultaneously aroused by the limitless possibility (and frankly, body of knowledge) of technologies and, well, intimidated, that would I qualify to be a consultant.

One girl from my batch told me that she is very unsatisfied with the compensation, while she couldn't write even a single line of code. "I don't like to code", said by the supposedly self-righteous "genius" among us. It's common practice for Japanese company to hand out a relatively low monthly salary and increase them yearly with a rather fixed rate. It's called "Nenko System", where the senior members receive higher compensation regardless of current contribution to the company or actual ability. IT industries don't do this. IT companies had to hand out much higher (1.5 times on average) compensation in order to obtain talents. After that, if you want a higher pay, you'd better get to be able to do something different. I don't plan on relying on the company to raise my value and salary, but rather try to use the resources and fantastic environment to learn, to practice, to gain hands-on hard-core project experiences. After that, I'm as free as a bird.

So the past two months, right, sorry for getting out of track. For the past two months I've been learning a lot, I took Azure's AI-100 and three other fundamental certificates, and I tried Google Cloud Platform's Professional Cloud Architect once but failed. In my own defense, THEY CHANGED THE EXAM! On 1st of May, Google changed the content of PCA exam, added bunch of new services into the content of exam, including some name-changing too. For instance, we've all learnt for PCA on Coursera's course offered by Google, where it's still "Stackdriver" for the new "Operations". There were also "Prometheus" in the exam which I've never even heard of before it.

Anyway, I failed, and I had to wait 2 weeks before retake it, so the meantime, I'm preparing for the Professional Data Engineer exam. I must say it's lots fun, the PDE exam, and these two months. It's like when I was a child, I'd read through the repair manual for TV or radio, tear them down and try to put them back. Only back then, I only had so much to tear down with. But it was always lots of fun.

I hope I can keep this streak of learning on and keep growing. Update again soon.
