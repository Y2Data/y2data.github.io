There's been a confusion in me about these two words: `Wettkampf` `Konkurrenz`.

Basically, `Wettkampf` means competition, a contest, an event, while `Konkurrenz` means a competitor, a person.

So there it goes.

* Verl√§ngerung (Extention)
* Verteidigung (Defense, of something good)
* fragen (ask)
* Niederlage (Defeat)
* fangen (catch)
* Siegerehrung (winners respect, Awards ceremony)
* Schiedsrichter (referee)
* Abwehr (Defense, against something bad)
* Angriff (tackle)
